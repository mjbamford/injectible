# A sample Guardfile
# More info at https://github.com/guard/guard#readme

## Uncomment and set this to only include directories you want to watch
# directories %w(app lib config test spec feature)

## Uncomment to clear the screen before every task
# clearing :on

## Make Guard exit when config is changed so it can be restarted
#
## Note: if you want Guard to automatically start up again, run guard in a
## shell loop, e.g.:
#
#  $ while bundle exec guard; do echo "Restarting Guard..."; done
#
## Note: if you are using the `directories` clause above and you are not
## watching the project directory ('.'), the you will want to move the Guardfile
## to a watched dir and symlink it back, e.g.
#
#  $ mkdir config
#  $ mv Guardfile config/
#  $ ln -s config/Guardfile .
#
# and, you'll have to watch "config/Guardfile" instead of "Guardfile"
#
watch ("Guardfile") do
  UI.info "Exiting because Guard must be restarted for changes to take effect"
  exit 0
